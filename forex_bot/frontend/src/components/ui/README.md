# Primitive UI Components (`frontend/src/components/ui`)

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `button.tsx` | Exports a `Button` component with size/variant props and Tailwind classes. |
| `card.tsx` | Provides `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, and `CardContent` layout components. |
| `input.tsx` | Exports an `Input` component that forwards refs to a styled `<input>`. |
| `select.tsx` | Exports a `Select` wrapper that standardises dropdown styling. |

These primitives are intentionally lightweight wrappers around semantic HTML
elements, enabling consistent styling across the dashboard.
