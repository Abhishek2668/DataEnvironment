# DataEnvironment

Data project and related mitigation.

## Branch Strategy

1. Start new feature branches from `develop`.
2. Use the `trial` branch as a temporary staging area for testing features together.
3. After validation on `trial`, merge changes back into `develop`, then create a release PR into `main`.

### Branch availability

Both the `develop` and `trial` branches have been created in this repository so contributors can follow the intended workflow immediately.
